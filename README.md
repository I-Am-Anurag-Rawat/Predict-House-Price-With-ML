# Predict-House-Price-With-ML

# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses a housing dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on key features like square footage, quality, garage area, and more. The model is built using Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, and visualizations are provided to aid analysis and interpretation.

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- ✅ Visualized correlations and feature relationships
- ✅ Removed outliers using the IQR method
- ✅ Built a **Linear Regression** model
- ✅ Evaluated performance using **R² Score** and **RMSE**
- ✅ Final model achieved:
  - 📈 **R² Score:** ~0.82
  - 📉 **RMSE:** ~24,093

## 📂 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset (e.g., `house_prices_records.csv`)
3. Run all cells in order
4. View analysis and model predictions

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Try other regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, RandomForest)
- Apply feature scaling and normalization
- Experiment with log transformation of target variable
- Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
